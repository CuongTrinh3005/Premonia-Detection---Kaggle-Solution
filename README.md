This is my project in Images Processing about Premonia Dection.

What are the main keys I learned from this project:
- Using transfer learning with pretrained model VGG to enhance the model's performance.
- Data Augmention will benefit the model.
- Processing data with H5 File.
- Hyperparameter such as learning rate significantly affect model. In this project I use lr=0.0001, which is really small to fit the data. If I use the larger learning rate, it will make the model has the weird bahavior.
